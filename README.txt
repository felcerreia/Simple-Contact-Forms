== Description ==

Simple Contact Forms is designed to strip all the hassle so you can insert contact forms where you want and how you want. It's incredibly simple to set up and use so you can spend more time working on the harder parts of your site.

Dropping Simple Contact Forms into your site allows users to complete your forms and interact with your site. A successful completion will trigger an email notification to you and create a record in the database, which is viewable in the WordPress Admin area.

Build your own contact forms with a number of configurable drag and drop fields. Fields can also be required for successful submission or excluded completely to be saved for later. The fields include:

* Plain text - Normal, Name and Email Address specific
* Textarea
* Checkboxe - Single or Multiple
* Dropdowns - Multiple Options

The plugin also has a number of options configurable in the WordPress admin area. These include:

* Form Titles
* Form Styling (Bootstrap only for now)
* Form Validation (reCAPTCHA and Maths test)
* Form Collapsable by a button
* Button Text & Icon
* Button Styling
* Destination Pages
* Email Address for Notification
* Email Subject for Notification
* Success Message Content

Simple Contact Forms was created and is managed by [Big Lemon Creative](http://www.biglemoncreative.co.uk).
